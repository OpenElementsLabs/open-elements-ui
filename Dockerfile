# The component showcase: a static Storybook build served by nginx.
#
# A Dockerfile rather than Coolify's static build pack, so the build command and
# the publish directory stay in version control and the whole thing is
# reproducible locally with `docker build . && docker run -p 8080:80 <image>`.
